# Project 2 Ideas!

Your second Project will be your first foray into building a full-stack application, from scratch, on your own.

Project 2 is really exciting! It can also, by nature, sound a bit overwhelming.

We want to see you succeed! So over this weekend, we want you to come up with some ideas for your Project 2. 

**We will be looking for 3 project ideas, turned in via pull request to this repository, that illustrate a rough concept of what you might do for your project 2!**

## Technical Requirements for P2:

Your app must:
- Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) that represents the main functional idea for your app. This doesn't include join tables or the user model which should be part of your class's boilerplate code.

> Note: If your app idea doesn't really call for more models, let your instructors know and they can suggest ideas for other sufficiently difficult replacements for this requirement.

- Include sign up/log in functionality, with hashed passwords & an authorization flow
- Incorporate at least one API. Examples include Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape. Maybe grab an API from this [list of free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data
- Include a readme file that explains how to use your app
- Have semantically clean HTML, CSS, and back-end code
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public



## Write your 3 ideas below this line:
<hr>

1. ### Community food donation app
An app that connects local cooks and bakers (Who want to make food, but can't give it to anyone because Covid) to locals in their area who request. 

#### MVP
- User login
- Data table to keep track of requests
- Data table to keep track of offers
- Geolocation API to search in the area
- Create, read, update, and delete requests/offers

#### Stretch goals
- List recipes you'd like to try (Data scrape them from Google?)
- Follow/like system
- Message functionality

### Play-By-Post App
An app that uses a rules-light table-top RPG system (Such as Skyfarer or Monster of the Week) that allows people to create games/characters and play games by forum post with their friends.

#### MVP
- User login
- Datatable to keep track of games
- Datatable to keep track of characters
- Create, read, update, and delete posts from you and your friends
- Light dice-rolling functionality (Nothing too complicated, it's not DnD)
- For the API call - I can't find any good APIs that'd be useful. Maybe data scrape information? Or an API to create random characters for the GM?

#### Stretch goals
- Private messaging with Socket
- Visual representation of the gameboard (Maybe with Canvas?)

### Space Travel app
Fun app full of SPACE FACTS. What's the weather on Mars today? What's a random exoplanet? What was NASA's photo of the day three years ago?

#### MVP
- Database to keep track of the user's planets
- Database to keep track of user's space travel ideas
- API calls to NASA's exoplanet API, weather API, API calls for days
- Create, read, update, and delete from travel journal

#### Strecth Goals
- Randomly generated news articles from "alien" civilizations.
